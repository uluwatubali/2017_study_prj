if item is in list:
```
$var in $list
```

What's diferrence between == and is?
 ==: Comparison of content
 is: Comparison of object
```
list1=['abcd']
list2=['abcd']

>> list1 == list2
True
>> list1 is list 2
False

```

Usage of none.
While wariable is not 0 nor null and we need to use it without error reference.

```
max_num = none

if(max_num == none):
  max_num = num
else(max_num < next_num):
  max_num = next_num

```
