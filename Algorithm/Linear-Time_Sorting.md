|Root to  leaf | Algorithm Execution|
|Path length   | Running time|
|Height        | Worst case of running time|  How fast algorthm is = How low could we make a tree


Use decision tree to represent all the possible answers.
- For binary decision, # leaves >= n. Height>= log(n)
- For sorting, # leaves = n!, Height>=log(n!) >= nlog(n)
